# Experiment tracking

In this directory we will be exploring the subject of Experiment tracking mainly with the usage of `MLflow`.

## Installation of mlflow

We will be installing the mlfow via terminal using `script.sh`. 

First we create a file called `script.sh`.
Then in the terminal we change the execution permission via:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

In the script we input the following commands:

```bash
pip install mlflow
```
and:

```bash
mlflow --version
```
Which returns:

```bash
mlflow, version 2.4.1
```
This means that on my machine version 2.4.1 was installed.
